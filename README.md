# Sri Supratik Talari â€“ AI/ML Challenge

Welcome to my **AI/ML Challenge Project**!

My name is Sri Supratik Talari I am a Data Science Major At University of California San Diego.

## Introduction

For this challenge I decided to pursue the ai/ml challenge which asked me to created a predictive model for stock prices. 
The dataset that I am using has information on the Aave stock from 2020-10-05 to 2021-07-06 which can be found on Kaggle.
The dataset has several features that provided infromation on the Aave stock. For our purposes we will only be using 
a selected set of all the available features. 

1. Date
   - The date the infromation was recorded
   
2. Low
   - The lowest price the stock reached on the recorded day

3. High
   - The highest price the stock reached on the recorded day

4. Close
   - The closing price the stock reached on the recorded day


## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Keep your code well-organized and documented.
- Include a `README.md` in your challenge folder with:
  - Your name
  - What you built
